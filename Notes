I walked through the basics of API design, learning how to set up the backbone of a REST API and how to structure the code in a logical manner.
<br>
I learned how to use basic implementation of CommonJS.

Firstly, I needed to set up and install the required dependencies and node modules for the app to work correctly.
<br>
As I created an API, it’s obvious a database was needed. I used MongoDB, a NOSQL database.

It was the optimal choice for my needs at the moment as I did not need a relational database. :)

Mongoose is an ORM — Object Relational Mapper. The official ORM used for MongoDB to be precise. 
I used use an ORM to simplify the transfer of data between our application and the database. 
ORM maps the data I have in my app to uphold a set of strict rules set by the database. The body-parser module is just a middleware we use to parse our data sent through HTTP requests.
