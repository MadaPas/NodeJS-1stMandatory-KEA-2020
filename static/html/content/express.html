                It has become the standard server framework for node.js. Express is the backend part of something known
                as the MEAN stack.<br>
                The MEAN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web
                applications which has the following components:<br>
                1. <b>MongoDB</b> - The standard NoSQL database
                <br>
                2. <b>Express.js</b> - The default web applications framework
                <br>
                3. <b>Angular.js</b> - The JavaScript MVC framework used for web applications
                <br>
                4. <b>Node.js</b> - Framework used for scalable server-side and networking applications

            <h4 class="doc-lead">Express Usage</h4>
            <p class="lead">The Express.js framework makes it very easy to develop an application which can be used to
                handle multiple types of requests like the GET, PUT, and POST and DELETE requests.</p>

            <p class="lead">
                Express gets installed via the Node Package Manager. This can be done by executing the following line in
                the command line: <br>
                <b>npm install express</b> <br>
                The above command requests the Node package manager to download the required express modules and install
                them accordingly. <br>
                Let's use our newly installed Express framework and create a simple "Hello World" application. <br>
                Our application is going to create a simple server module which will listen on port number 3000. In our
                example, if a request is made through the browser on this port number, then server application will send
                a 'Hello' World' response to the client.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/express.JPG" alt="How to use express" width="700" height="300"></img>

            <p class="lead">
                1. In our first line of code, we are using the require function to include the "express module."
                <br>
                2. Before we can start using the express module, we need to make an object of it.
                <br>
                3. Here we are creating a callback function. This function will be called whenever anybody browses to
                the root of our web application which is http://localhost:3000 . The callback function will be used to
                send the string 'Hello World' to the web page.
                <br>
                4. In the callback function, we are sending the string "Hello World" back to the client. The 'res'
                parameter is used to send content back to the web page. This 'res' parameter is something that is
                provided by the 'request' module to enable one to send content back to the web page.
                <br>
                5. We are then using the listen to function to make our server application listen to client requests on
                port no 3000. You can specify any available port over here.
                <br>
            </p>

            <h4 class="doc-lead">What are Routes?</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                Routing determine the way in which an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint.
                <br>
                For example, a client can make a GET, POST, PUT or DELETE http request for various URL such as the ones
                shown below: <br>
                <h><b>
                    http://localhost:3000/Books<br>
                    http://localhost:3000/Students</b></h><br><br>
                    If a GET request is made for the first URL, then the response should ideally be a list of books.<br>
                    If the GET request is made for the second URL, then the response should ideally be a list of Students.<br>
                    So based on the URL which is accessed, a different functionality on the webserver will be invoked, and accordingly, the response will be sent to the client. This is the concept of routing.<br>
