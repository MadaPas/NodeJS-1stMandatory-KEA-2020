                jQuery is an open source JavaScript library that simplifies the interactions between an HTML/CSS
                document, or more precisely the Document Object Model (DOM), and JavaScript.
                Elaborating the terms, jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing and manipulation, browser event
                handling, DOM animations, Ajax interactions, and cross-browser JavaScript development.
                <br>
                <b>Note:</b> The only library available today that meets the needs of both designer types and programmer
                types is jQuery.

            <h4 class="doc-lead"> WHY jQuery?</h4>
            <p class="lead">
                It is incredibly popular, which is to say it has a large community of users and a healthy amount of
                contributors who participate as developers and evangelists.
                <br>
                It normalizes the differences between web browsers so that you don’t have to.
                <br>
                It is intentionally a lightweight footprint with a simple yet clever plugin architecture.
                <br>
                Its repository of plugins is vast and has seen steady growth since jQuery’s release.
                <br>
                Its API is fully documented, including inline code examples, which in the world of JavaScript libraries
                is a luxury. Heck, any documentation at all was a luxury for years.
                <br>
                It is friendly, which is to say it provides helpful ways to avoid conflicts with other JavaScript
                libraries.
                <br><br>
                jQuery is widely famous with its philosophy of “Write less, do more.” This philosophy can be further
                elaborated as three concepts:<br>

                        1. Finding some elements (via CSS selectors) and doing something with them (via jQuery methods)
                            i.e. locate a set of elements in the DOM, and then do something with that set of elements.<br>
                        2. Chaining multiple jQuery methods on a set of elements<br>
                        3. Using the jQuery wrapper and implicit iteration<br>
