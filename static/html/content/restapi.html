            <p class="lead">
                <b>RE</b>presentational <b>S</b>tate <b>T</b>ransfer <b>(REST)</b> is an architectural style that
                defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.
                REST API is a way of accessing the web services in a simple and flexible way without having any
                processing.<br>

                REST technology is generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
                technology because REST uses the less bandwidth,
                simple and flexible making it more suitable for internet usage. It’s used to fetch or give some
                information from a web services.
                All communication done via REST API used only HTTP request.<br>
                A request is send from client to server in the form of web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or DELETE.
                After that a response is come back from server in the form of resource which can be anything like HTML,
                XML, Image or JSON.
                But now JSON is the most popular format being used in Web Services.<br>

                In HTTP there are five methods which are commonly used in a REST based Architecture i.e., POST, GET,
                PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations
                respectively.
                <br>
                <b>There are other methods which are less frequently used like OPTIONS and HEAD.</b> <br>
            </p>
            <p class="lead">

                <b>1. GET</b>: The HTTP GET method is used to <b>read</b> (or retrieve) a representation of a resource.
                In the safe path, GET returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (OK). In
                an error case, it most often returns a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST).
                <br><br>
                <b>2. POST</b>: The POST verb is most-often utilized to <b>create</b> new resources. In particular, it’s
                used to create subordinate resources. That is, subordinate to some other (e.g. parent) resource. On
                successful creation, return HTTP status 201, returning a Location header with a link to the
                newly-created resource with the 201 HTTP status.
                <br>
                <b>NOTE: POST is neither safe nor idempotent.</b>
                <br><br>
                <b>3. PUT</b>: It is used for <b>updating</b> the capabilities. However, PUT can also be used to create
                a resource in the case where the resource ID is chosen by the client instead of by the server. In other
                words, if the PUT is to a URI that contains the value of a non-existent resource ID. On successful
                update, return 200 (or 204 if not returning any content in the body) from a PUT. If using PUT for
                create, return HTTP status 201 on successful creation. PUT is not safe operation but it’s idempotent.
                <br><br>
                <b>4. PATCH</b>: It is used for <b>modifying</b> capabilities. The PATCH request only needs to contain
                the changes to the resource, not the complete resource. This resembles PUT, but the body contains a set
                of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the server should be modified to produce
                a new version. This means that the PATCH body should not just be a modified part of the resource, but in
                some kind of patch language like JSON Patch or XML Patch. PATCH is neither safe nor idempotent.
                <br><br>
                <b>5. DELETE</b>: It is used to <b>delete</b> a resource identified by a URI. On successful deletion,
                return HTTP status 200 (OK) along with a response body.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                <b>Idempotence</b>: An idempotent HTTP method is a HTTP method that can be called many times without
                different outcomes. It would not matter if the method is called only once, or ten times over. The result
                should be the same. Again, this only applies to the result, not the resource itself.
