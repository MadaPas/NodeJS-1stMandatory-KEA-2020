    This site was created for displaying the first mandatory assignment in the Node.JS elective class at
    KEA - 2020.
                    
    The objectives are to program a simple web application with express.
    The hosted site should contain multiple endpoints (html views), documenting what we've learned so far in class.
                    
    Requirements:
    1. Serve the pages with express.
    2. Split up the documentation in segments, rather than one long page.
    3. Should contain commands.
    4. Should contain all the tools we've used and explain them.
    5. Should cover theory that we've touched upon.
                   
    A bonus objective (not mandatory) is to research something new and implement it.
    --> I played around with my first API :) and I tested using Postman.
